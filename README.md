# Weather-App
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a weather website. Based on the Free API data from OpenWeatherMap, we will display weather data, such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions. It will include a search box that allows users to enter the name of a city and get weather information for that city.
